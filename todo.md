# DRIFT: Dynamic Road Interaction Flow Tool

## TODO
- [x] multiple import formats (e.g., OSM, custom CSV)
- [x] test other networkx files
- [ ] Visualization improvements
  - [x] Plot legend
  - [x] Some speed loss because of data sent to the ploting ? -> _emit in Thread
  - [x] Better network viz (keep all the node, smaller dot)
  - [x] Button to reset visualization position and zoom
- [x] Plot Hours instead 6->30, 6am->5:59am (24h)
- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] docstrings
  - [x] README.md
    - [ ] Modify accordingly to the github repo
- [ ] clean code
  - [x] class for file opener
  - [x] remove useless code
  - [x] Remove duplicated code from :  _final_simulation_validation()
  - [x] create lib folder and keep the main.py out
  - [x] Fix error: "Unknown property fcolor"
- [x] icon & name + current open file
- [x] smoother agent movement
- [x] in hub model, agent_type (hub/nohub)
- [x] Tab to see statistics of the simulation in real-time (e.g., average speed, congestion points)
- [x] Export simulation results to CSV or JSON
- [x] Fix style in each st-model
  - [x] Color of agent in activity
  - [x] Hub
  - [x] Gravity
- [ ] Compute Gravity with thread so the windows doesn't freeze
- [x] Bug a lot of agent with 06:00:00
- [x] Unknow start node in the trip tab, 0 average speed, 0 distance, 0 duration
- [x] Refactor OOP class of the gui_main.py while applying MVC pattern
- [x] Add setting tab to setup parameters of each model and Bureau of Public Roads (congestion model)
- [ ] check if changing parameters really affect the st models
- [ ] check if changing parameters really affect the simulation
- [ ] Network general statistics
  - [x] Numerical value for diameter
  - [x] Error for Average clustering computation (N/A) - ⚠️ Clustering calculation error: not implemented for multigraph type
  - [ ] Clear stats (general) when stop the simulation
  - [ ] self-loop edges
  - [ ] Coordinate ranges: X(13.108, 13.742), Y(52.342, 52.656)
- [x] Border for the plots
- [x] Average number of node by trips
- [x] Hide in log "Background network rendered to cache"
- [ ] Export stats in CSV file
- [ ] Create .exe file for Windows
