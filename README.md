## Overview

DRIFT (DRIve Fleet Tool) represents individual vehicles as discrete agents with unique trajectories and behavioral profiles, while simultaneously capturing aggregate traffic dynamics at the network level. It provides a flexible framework for transportation researchers to study mobility dynamics, congestion patterns, and network optimization.

## Key Features

### üöó Agent-Based Mesoscopic Simulation

- Individual vehicle tracking with unique IDs and behavioral profiles
- Link-level flow management for efficient large-scale simulation
- Discrete time steps with continuous-time representation
- Real-time multipliers for accelerated simulation
- Multi-day simulation horizons (up to 48 hours)

### üìä Multiple Demand Models

- **Random Model**: Uniform distribution of trips across all nodes
- **Activity-Based Model**: Trips based on individual activities and purposes
- **Zone-Based Model**: Geographic zone-based trip distribution
- **Gravity Model**: Distance-decay based trip generation
- **Hub-and-Spoke Model**: Centralized flow patterns through hub nodes

### üö¶ Congestion Modeling

## Source-Target Models

### Random Model

All nodes have equal probability for origin/destination selection.

### Activity-Based Model

Agents have individual activity patterns and preferences for trip generation.

### Zone-Based Model

Network is partitioned into geographic zones with configurable inter/intra-zone probabilities.

### Gravity Model

Trip distribution follows gravitational principles: `T_ij = K * (S_i * A_j) / d_ij^Œ≤`

### Hub-and-Spoke Model

High-centrality nodes act as hubs, concentrating flows from peripheral nodes.

## Technical Details

- **Congestion Function**: BPR model with configurable Œ±=0.15, Œ≤=4.0 parameters
- **Time Resolution**: Discrete time steps with continuous-time representation
- **Architecture**: Modular design with plugin-style s-t model integration
- **Visualization**: Performance-optimized rendering with level-of-detail adjustments
